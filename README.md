# Smart-House
The integration of IOT using ESP32 (C++) and android application (Java) to make a smart house.

This Github project is focused on creating an integration between a mobile application and IoT to develop a Smart House system. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface that enables users to control their house appliances remotely via their mobile devices.

The project will be implemented using Java programming language and the ESP32 microcontroller unit. The ESP32 MCU will be used to control the devices in the Smart House, while the mobile application will serve as the interface for the user to communicate with the MCU.

The project will consist of two main parts: the mobile application and the hardware implementation. The mobile application will be developed using Android Studio and will provide an easy-to-use interface for the user. The application will be able to communicate with the ESP32 MCU via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

On the other hand, the hardware implementation will be carried out using the ESP32 MCU. The MCU will be responsible for controlling various devices in the house such as lights, fans, air conditioners, and so on. The MCU will be programmed using the Arduino IDE and the code will be written in C++.

The project will include a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up the hardware and software components of the project. This will include the schematic diagrams, bill of materials, and code snippets ...
